# Project 2: A Community Project
by Jose Ochoa

# project overview 

In this project, we were tasked with creating a website that exclusively relies on text and color for interactivity. The objective was to represent the concept of community through these two limited elements. 

I chose the poem ‘I Hear America Singing’ by Walt Whitman because it celebrates diversity within America. I think there are many problems with Americans, but I think the biggest community I am a part of is my nationality, American. The poem includes a diverse amount of people, from jobs to gender, and it celebrates the unity of them all as Americans. They all sing with pride and enthusiasm together, which is what I imagine a happy community looks like. 

When I read the poem, I get a sense of happiness and hopefulness, which I feel is an important identity in all my communities. The poem also has a variety of descriptive words that seem fun to work within our project. Even in the title, the word singing can be personified in many ways, which intrigued me. The poem is also small in length, so I can spend time on the interactions rather than the amount of words I have to make interactions. 


# technical overview
The project consists of twelve HTML pages and a single CSS page. A recurring design element on all HTML pages is the gradient text, 'singin,' which serves to unify the entire website.

The first HTML page features a rainbow gradient background with the word 'hear' gradually increasing in size. This effect is intended to draw the user's attention to the word 'hear' and its significance.

On the seventh HTML page, we've introduced a background color change and text color alteration to represent the transition from morning to afternoon as reflected in the poetry line.

(will add more once more is added to css)
