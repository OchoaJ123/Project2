# Time Capsule: An Instagram Self Portrait
by Jose Ochoa

# project overview 

The time capsule webpage encompasses Jose's journey through photography. His digital time capsule is focused on photos he takes and uploads to Instagram, a social media app. The website shows his likes and activities: hiking, camping, and socializing. 

# technical overview

The website includes HTML and CSS to build the text, images, and layout. 

There are three separate HTML and CSS profiles: home, likes, and activities. There are three web pages, so multiple HTML and CSS files must be needed. HTML is used for structure, while CSS is used for styling.

For the navigation bar, I used the justify-content to center the links and then used margins and padding to space the objects. 

I used classes to separate the different sections while incorporating a flex box system. Each section has a border with a large image and text and three smaller pictures. The home page has one section, while the likes and activate pages have two sections. A grouping of content separates each section.
